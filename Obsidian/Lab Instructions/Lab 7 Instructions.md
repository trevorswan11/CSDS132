# Programming in Java: Lab 7  
Working With 2D Arrays and JUnit

In this lab, you will write methods using 2D arrays test your results with JUnit

## Task 1. Assigning Lab Partners 

Your lab TA will help assign lab partners. You may keep your lab partner from last week, but you do not need to.

## Reminder About The Rules For The Lab

### If You Do Not Have a Lab Partner

You are to do the tasks listed below. The tasks require you to write a class that contains specific methods. You need to complete all the methods as described. If you fail to complete all the tasks by the end of lab, you may continue to work on them, but you must complete the lab prior to the deadline posted.

### If You Have a Lab Partner

You will play two different roles in the lab. You will either be the _driver_ or _navigator_.

- **driver:** The person typing in the code.
- **navigator:** The person watching for mistakes, making suggestions, and thinking ahead.

_**Important:** The navigator must not edit the code._

Choose one of you to begin as the driver. The other will be the navigator, and the lab will tell you when to switch roles.

As in last week's lab, you will write a class that you will submit at the end of lab. You do not have to complete all the tasks by the end of the lab because you are being graded on how well you work as a team. You do have to make a good effort and work for the entire 50 minute lab to get full credit.

**If you are a novice programmer, your goal is to complete at least at least the first three methods of the lab . If you have not completed the second method and there is less than 15 minutes left in the lab, please ask one of the lab assistants for help.**

## Task 2. Introductions and Starting DrJava

Tell your lab partner your name as well whether you like to study in quiet places or noisy places.

Choose one of you to start as the driver, and launch DrJava.

---

## Task 3. Using JUnit

Download both the Array2Lab.java file and the Array2LabTester.java file. Load them in DrJava and compile them.

The Array2Lab.java file has a bunch of methods that do practically nothing. Your task in this lab is to get as many of these methods working as you can.

The Array2LabTester.java file has methods to test the methods of Array2Lab.java using the JUnit testing package. These methods have been created for you in this lab. You can run these tests by clicking the _Test_ button at the top of DrJava.

## Task 4. Writing and Testing Your Code

First, place you name and your lab partner's name at the top of the Array2Lab.java file.

**Step 1:** Write the contains method and test it using the _Test_ button until the test for contains is green.

You are not to modify the Array2LabTester.java test cases for the contains method.

The comment above each method explains what the method should do. The _Precondition_ is a statement that describes what you can assume will be true about the parameters to the method. The _Postcondition_ statement lists something that, if your code is correct, will be true when the method returns.

**Switch roles, the driver should navigate and the navigator should drive.**

**Step 2:** Write the arrayToString method and test it using the _Test_ button.

_Demonstrate your method and show your test case to the lab assistant._

**Switch roles, the driver should navigate and the navigator should drive.**

**Step 3:** Write the transpose method and test it using JUnit.

**Switch roles, the driver should navigate and the navigator should drive.**

**Step 4:** Write the removeRowAndCol method and test it using JUnit.

## Task Last. Finishing Up

Once completed, submit your Array2Lab.java file. _Remember that both you and your lab partner should submit this file._
