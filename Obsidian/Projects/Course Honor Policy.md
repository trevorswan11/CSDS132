See the university policy on academic integrity for general rules that you should follow on tests and quizzes. Rules specific to programming in this class are listed here.

Programming is a collaborative enterprise. However, you cannot be an equal collaborator until you first build up your own programming skill set. Because of that, it is essential that you do pre-lab and programming project coding on your own. That does not mean that you can not seek help or give help to other students, but the assistance must be at a high level - for example English descriptions of how to solve a problem and not coding descriptions. **The most important skill you will develop in this class is to translate a solution description into the Java commands needed to implement the solution.** If you copy code from other sources, you are not developing this needed skill for yourself.

Here is a short list of things you may and may not do:

- **DO NOT** send an electronic copy of your code to another student. (Exception: You may share with your lab partner a copy of the code you wrote together during the recitation section.)
    
- **DO NOT** look at another person's code for the purpose of writing your own.
    
- **DO NOT** tell another student the Java code needed for an assignment.
    
- **DO** sit down with a student and go over the student's code together in order to help the student find a bug.
    
- **DO** describe in English (not code!) the steps needed to solve an assignment problem.
    
- **DO** show students how to do certain Java coding tasks _as long as the task does not directly relate to a homework question_.
    
- **DO** use coding examples from the lecture and textbook as a guide in your programming.
    
- **DO NOT** search the internet to find the exact solutions to assignment problems.
    
- **DO NOT** post code you write for this class onto an internet site such as StackExchange.
    
- **DO NOT** post the homework specific problem descriptions onto internet sites such as StackExchange.
