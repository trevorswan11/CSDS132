## Basic Class Structure
To design a class hierarchy for the given types using good object-oriented design principles, we can start by identifying common behaviors and properties that can be abstracted into interfaces or abstract classes. Here’s a sketch of the class hierarchy:

1. Function Interface: This would be the top-level interface with the methods value() and derivative(). All types will implement this interface since they all need these methods.
    
2. AbstractFunction Class: An abstract class that implements the Function interface. It can provide a default implementation of the value() method that throws UnsupportedOperationException, which can be overridden by concrete classes.
    
3. Variable Class: Extends AbstractFunction. Represents the variable x with no input for the constructor. Overrides toString() and equals() as specified.
    
4. Number Class: Extends AbstractFunction. Represents a number and takes a double in the constructor. Overrides toString() and equals() as specified.
    
5. BinaryOp Class: Extends AbstractFunction. Represents a binary operation and takes an enum for the operator and two Function operands. Includes getter methods and overrides toString() and equals() as specified.
    
6. Polynomial Class: Extends AbstractFunction. Represents a function raised to a power and takes a Function operand and a double for the power. Includes getter methods and overrides toString() and equals() as specified.
    
7. UnaryOperation Abstract Class: An abstract class that extends AbstractFunction and represents operations with a single operand, such as Log, Exp, Sin, and Cos. It includes a protected member for the operand and a getter method.
    
8. Log Class: Extends UnaryOperation. Represents the natural logarithm function. Overrides toString() and equals() as specified.
    
9. Exp Class: Extends UnaryOperation. Represents the exponential function. Overrides toString() and equals() as specified.
    
10. Sin Class: Extends UnaryOperation. Represents the sine function. Overrides toString() and equals() as specified.
    
11. Cos Class: Extends UnaryOperation. Represents the cosine function. Overrides toString() and equals() as specified.
    

In this hierarchy:

- Interfaces are used to define the contract that all function types must adhere to.
    
- Abstract classes are used to provide default behavior that can be shared across multiple concrete classes.
    
- Concrete classes are used to implement specific behaviors for the different function types.
    

This design allows for flexibility and extensibility. If new function types need to be added in the future, they can extend the appropriate abstract class or implement the Function interface directly. The use of an enum for the BinaryOp operator allows for easy expansion to include new operators if needed. The hierarchy is designed to minimize code duplication and ensure that each class has a single responsibility.

## Expounding on the Abstract Classes
Exploring the `AbstractFunction` and `UnaryOperation` abstract classes:

### AbstractFunction Class

The `AbstractFunction` class serves as a foundational building block in our class hierarchy. It implements the `Function` interface, which mandates the presence of the `value()` and `derivative()` methods. Here’s what the `AbstractFunction` class provides:

- **Default Behavior for `value()`:** It offers a default implementation of the `value()` method that throws an `UnsupportedOperationException`. This is because not all function types will require an input to compute a value. For instance, a constant function can return its value without any input.
    
- **Abstract `derivative()` Method:** The `derivative()` method remains abstract in this class because the derivative’s computation is unique to each function type.
    
- **Shared Functionality:** Any common code that’s shared across multiple function types can be placed here to reduce redundancy. For example, if there’s a common way to check for equality or hash code generation, it would go here.
    

### UnaryOperation Abstract Class

The `UnaryOperation` abstract class is a specialized form of `AbstractFunction` designed for operations that involve a single operand, such as logarithmic, exponential, sine, and cosine functions. Here’s what it encapsulates:

- **Single Operand:** It holds a protected member variable that represents the single operand, which is a `Function` type. This allows subclasses to access the operand directly.
    
- **Getter Method:** It provides a `getOperand()` method, enabling subclasses to retrieve the operand when needed, such as for computing values or derivatives.
    
- **Common Unary Behaviors:** If there are behaviors or checks that are common to all unary operations, they can be implemented here. For example, a common `toString()` method format could be provided, which subclasses can override for specific formatting.
    

By using these abstract classes, we ensure that our hierarchy is well-organized and that classes are not burdened with unnecessary implementations. Subclasses can override and extend these abstract classes to provide specific behaviors for different function types. This design promotes code reuse and adheres to the principle of single responsibility, where each class has a clear and distinct role within the hierarchy.

## Derivative Algorithm
An algorithmic approach to compute the derivatives of the different function types:

1. **Variable (x):**
    
    - The derivative of a variable `x` with respect to itself is always 1.
2. **Number (constant):**
    
    - The derivative of any constant is 0.
3. **BinaryOp (+, -, _, /):**
    
    - For addition (`+`) and subtraction (`-`), the derivative is the sum or difference of the derivatives of the operands.
    - For multiplication (`*`), use the product rule: the derivative of `f * g` is `f' * g + f * g'`, where `f'` and `g'` are the derivatives of `f` and `g`, respectively.
    - For division (`/`), use the quotient rule: the derivative of `f / g` is `(f' * g - f * g') / g^2`.
4. **Polynomial (function raised to a power):**
    
    - Use the power rule: the derivative of `f^n` is `n * f^(n-1) * f'`, where `f'` is the derivative of the function `f`.
5. **Log (natural logarithm):**
    
    - The derivative of `Log[f]` is `f' / f`, where `f'` is the derivative of the function `f`.
6. **Exp (natural exponential):**
    
    - The derivative of `Exp[f]` is `Exp[f] * f'`, where `f'` is the derivative of the function `f`.
7. **Sin (sine function):**
    
    - The derivative of `Sin[f]` is `Cos[f] * f'`, where `f'` is the derivative of the function `f`.
8. **Cos (cosine function):**
    
    - The derivative of `Cos[f]` is `-Sin[f] * f'`, where `f'` is the derivative of the function `f`.

For each of these, you would recursively apply the derivative rules based on the type of the function. For example, if you have a `BinaryOp` that is an addition of a `Number` and a `Variable`, you would take the derivative of each separately (0 for the `Number` and 1 for the `Variable`) and then add them together.

Someone on GitHub also posted a complex derivative method [here](https://github.com/Folk4681/Derivative-Calculator-in-Java)

Remember, this is a high-level algorithmic description. The actual implementation would require careful consideration of the order of operations and the handling of special cases, such as the derivative of a function at a point where it is not differentiable.
