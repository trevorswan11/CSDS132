<h1>Programming in Java: Lab 1
<br>
Primitive Types <br>
Getting Comfortable with DrJava </h1>


<p>The purpose of this lab is to get you used to using DrJava, to start experimenting with Java expressions,
and to understand some of the issues involved in representing and manipulating data with a computer.  </p>

<hr>

<h2>Task 1: Getting a Lab Partner</h2>

<p>The first thing that will occur in this lab is the assigning of lab partners.
The teaching assistants in the recitation will pair you with another student.  If there is a person you want to 
work with, let the teaching assistants know.
</p>


<hr>

<h2>Rules For The Lab</h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Your grade will be determined by how well you work as a member of a team.</strong>
You will play two different roles in the lab.  You will either be the
<em>driver</em> or <em>navigator</em>.
<ul>
<li><strong>driver:</strong> The person typing at the keyboard.</li>
<li><strong>navigator:</strong> The person watching for mistakes, making suggestions,
                      and thinking ahead.</li>
</ul>

<em><strong>Important: The driver is the only one who may do the typing or otherwise edit the document or enter the code.
The navigator must not jump in and start editing.</strong></em>
</p>

<p>Choose one of you to begin as the driver.  The other will be the navigator, and the lab will tell you
when to switch roles.</p>

<p><em>You do not have to complete all the tasks
by the end of lab</em>, but you do have to make a good effort.<br> 
<strong>The only ways to lose points when working as a team is 1) you do not show up on time, 
2) you goof off,
3) you are the navigator and you take over editing the document from the driver, or 
4) you are the navigatpr and you sit quietly and never offer suggestions.</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>If you are unable to attend the recitation</strong> then you must do this lab exercise on your own.
In that case, your grade will be the percent of the exercises you complete.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Task 2: Introductions</h2>

<p>If you have a lab partner, tell your partner your name as well as your favorite snack food.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Task 3: Starting DrJava</h2>

<p><em>DrJava</em> is what is known as an <em>integrated development environment</em>
(or IDE for short) for Java.  An IDE is an application that assists programmers
in writing computer programs.  There are a large number of IDEs available
for many different languages, and we will be using DrJava for writing 
Java in our class because DrJava is particularly good for new programmers.</p>

<p>DrJava is available on Case's MyApps (myapps.case.edu).  Log in with your Case ID and password,
launch the "student desktop" and choose DrJava from the applications list.</p>

<p>You are allowed to use a different IDE <em>if both you and your lab partner want to</em> and the IDE should have JShell installed,
but these labs exercises are designed for DrJava.  If either you or your lab partner is a coding novice, then you should use DrJava.
<strong>Do not pressure your lab partner into using a different IDE.</strong></p>

<h3> Testing DrJava </h3>

<p>All programming languages have their own quirks with how they manipulate numbers and other data.  In this lab, you will
begin exploring the syntactic form of Java expressions as well as their semantic meaning.</p>

<p>
In this lab, you will be entering code fragments in the Interactions Pane
of DrJava.  At the bottom of the DrJava window, you should see several tabs.
Click on the one that is labeled <em>Interactions</em>.  You should see
<pre>
Welcome to DrJava.
&gt;
</pre>
You will enter the code fragments at the <tt>&gt;</tt> prompt.
</p>
<p>Try it now.  Type:
<pre>1+2</pre>
at the <tt>&gt;</tt> prompt and press the <em>Enter</em> key.  The interactions pane should respond with
<pre>3</pre></p>

<p>The Interactions Pane is the reason DrJava is a very nice IDE for
beginning programmers.  You can enter pieces of Java code into the 
Interactions Pane in order to test the code and see what happens.  This way,
you can get started working in Java without having to write an entire Java
program. </p>

<p><em>If you are not using DrJava, you can get the same effect by using JShell in your IDE, but you need to be using Java 9 or greater.</em></p>


<hr />
<h2>Task 4: Questions and Answers</h2>
<p>You will be writing a <em>lab report</em> in this lab.  I recommend using the editor window of DrJava to type in your answers and to save them as a .txt file.  Alternatively, you can open a google doc shared with your lab partner.</p>
<p>Place both of your names into the document.</p>

<p>
Follow the following procedure through the lab.
<ol>
<li> Look over the lines you are asked to type into the interactions pane.  Discuss with your lab partner
what you think the results should be.</li>
<li>Type the expressions <em>one at a time</em> into the Interactions Pane of DrJava and see what happens. (If you try to copy and paste all of them at once, you will get a Java error.)</li>
<li>Discuss the results with your lab partner, read the questions that follow and see if you can answer them.
If you are unsure, you can enter more test cases into the interactions pane.</li>
<li>Write your answers or explanations to the following questions in the lab report document.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>If you are new to Java your goal is to get through question 6 below.  If you have previously coded in Java, try to get through question 8.</h3>

<p><strong>At the end of lab</strong>, both you and your partner will submit the report.  If you click on the <em>Lab 1</em> link on Canvas
to find the form for submitting the lab.</p>

<p>The questions below cover some features of numbers in Java.  Don't worry
about trying to remember all the syntax.  We will be covering this
in more detail later.  Right now, just focus on the <em>behavior</em> of the
different Java expressions below. </p>

<p><strong>Remember, only the driver is to type either in DrJava or on the lab report.  The navigator is to think
and offer suggestions.</strong></p>

Write up your answers on your lab report.
<ol>
<li>What does the <tt>=</tt> operator do?</li>
<li>In your own words, explain the behavior of the line <tt>x = x + 1</tt>.</li>
